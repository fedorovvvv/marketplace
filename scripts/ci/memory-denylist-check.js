/**
 * An agent that is not trusted to write memory must not hold ANY memory write tool — under EITHER
 * name the relay can be reached by.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH. Denylists across the marketplace express "this role does not
 * write memory" by naming the write tools one by one. That is a hand-maintained enumeration of a
 * set that grows — and when the memory relay went from 13 tools to 27, all 27 restricted agents
 * kept naming only the old three. `document_delete` (irreversible, cascades to every fact
 * extracted from a document), `bank_config_set` (rewrites the bank's behaviour) and
 * `memory_invalidate` became reachable by every Profile A creator and Profile B reviewer in the
 * marketplace, and nothing anywhere said so. The surface grew; the guards did not.
 *
 * So the required set is NOT written here. It is read from the plugin that owns the tools —
 * `plugins/fpl-hsmem/src/lib/tool-names.ts`, export `MEMORY_WRITE_TOOLS` — which makes the next
 * tool addition a decision ("is this a write?") instead of an omission.
 *
 * BOTH PREFIXES, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. A denylist matches an EXACT string. The same
 * relay is reachable under two names depending on how it was wired:
 *
 *   mcp__hindsight__<tool>                    — hand-wired as a server in .mcp.json
 *   mcp__plugin_fpl-hsmem_hindsight__<tool>   — installed as this plugin
 *
 * A denylist naming only one spelling denies NOTHING under the other wiring. The first version of
 * this gate compared bare names with the prefix stripped, which made it blind to exactly that: it
 * certified 27 agents as compliant while every one of them named only the plugin spelling, in a
 * workspace whose own standing rules describe `.mcp.json` wiring as supported. The gate reported a
 * property strictly weaker than the one it was written to enforce, and its self-test had no case
 * that could tell the difference. Found by an independent review (EVID-257 F1), not by this file.
 *
 * WHICH AGENTS ARE IN SCOPE. Only those that already deny `memory_retain` (under either spelling).
 * That is the marker of a role which has decided it does not write memory; this check holds it to
 * that decision in full. An agent with no memory denial at all is out of scope — that is a
 * different question (whether it SHOULD restrict memory), and answering it here would turn one gate
 * into two. That boundary has a known cost, named rather than hidden: `fpl-hsmem`'s own
 * `memory-curator` legitimately retains into the bank it curates, so it never enters scope even
 * though it holds the most bank-write authority in the marketplace (EVID-257 F3).
 *
 * Read-only. Never rewrites an agent file: a denylist is a security boundary, and a script that
 * edits security boundaries to make itself pass is the failure mode, not the fix.
