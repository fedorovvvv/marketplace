# Enrich memory from sources

A bank that only learns from what happens to be said in a session never learns what the team
already decided. This skill closes that gap — deliberately, in reviewed batches.

**Memory, not a document store.** A memory item is one short, self-contained statement that a
future reader can act on without opening anything: *what was decided, about which system, and
why*; or *what was tried and rejected, and why*; or *what went wrong and how to avoid it*. The
document it came from stays where it is, and the item links to it. Copying a document into the
bank buries the one sentence that matters under a page that does not, and every recall pays for it.

**Docs outrank memory.** When an item and its source disagree, the source wins — the item is a
pointer with a summary, not a second source of truth. That is why every item carries a link and a
timestamp, and why superseded decisions are recorded *as* superseded rather than left to look
current.

## Model tier

**This skill asks for tier B for the distillation, C for the dry run and apply.**

Deciding what in an ADR is non-obvious, and stating the *why* in two sentences, is judgement: a
vague or wrong item is recalled into every future session that brushes the topic. The writes are
mechanical and the tool validates them.

`model:` values like `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` are Claude Code names, not the requirement. On
another runtime substitute whatever serves this tier there, and when you cannot tell, miss
**upward**.

## Before you start

```
memory_get_current_bank
```

It lists the allowed banks. Every item goes to exactly one bank — either named on the item or
routed by repository through the project's `routing` map (see CONFIGURATION.md). If the right bank
for this source is not in the list, stop and say so: this plugin never creates a bank.

Then check what is already there, so you do not re-distil what a teammate already loaded:

```
document_list  q=decision:<repo>      # stable ids make this exact
memory_recall  query="what did we decide about <area> in <repo>"
```

## The procedure

1. **Pick one source and its scope** — one repository's design records, one ledger, one review
   thread. A file per source keeps a refusal or a revert local.
2. **Read it from the right place** — see the recipes below. Never from a stale working tree.
3. **Distil** into items (rules below). Fewer, sharper items beat many: quality over count.
4. **Write the JSONL file** inside the project, in a scratch location that is not committed.
5. **Dry run** — nothing is written:

   ```
   memory_retain_batch  file=<path>.jsonl
   ```

   It validates every line, resolves each item's bank (explicit, else `routing` by
   `metadata.repo`), refuses lines carrying secrets or personal data, and reports counts per bank
   and kind, refused lines with line numbers, which `document_id`s already exist (apply replaces
   them), and a couple of samples.
6. **Show the human** the summary, the refused lines and 3–5 representative items per bank —
   verbatim, not paraphrased. Fix a refused line by rewording or removing the sensitive part, never
   by weakening the scan. Re-run the dry run until the report is what you mean to write.
7. **Apply only after the human approves that report** in this conversation:

   ```
   memory_retain_batch  file=<path>.jsonl  apply=true
   ```

   Items are queued asynchronously, in batches per bank; the report prints operation ids.
8. **Verify, do not assume.**

   ```
   memory_operations  status=failed  limit=10
   memory_recall      query="<a question one of the new items should answer>"
   ```

   Ask two or three real questions. Extraction takes a little while; a failed job is visible only
   in `memory_operations`.

**Rollback.** Every write replaces by `document_id`, so re-applying a corrected file fixes the
items in place. To withdraw an item entirely, `document_delete` its `document_id` (it removes only
that item's memories and asks for confirmation), or retire a single wrong fact with
/fpl-hsmem:correct-memory. Dropping an item from the file does **not** delete it from the bank.

## Item shape — one JSON object per line

```json
{"kind": "decision", "content": "<system>: <what was decided>. Why: <the reason>.",
 "context": "<source type> <ARTIFACT-ID> in <repo>: <title>", "timestamp": "2026-05-06",
 "document_id": "decision:<repo>:<ARTIFACT-ID>:<slug>",
 "tags": ["source:<type>", "repo:<repo>", "kind:decision", "artifact:<ARTIFACT-ID>", "status:active"],
 "metadata": {"link": "<repo>:<path>@<short-commit>", "artifact": "<ARTIFACT-ID>", "repo": "<repo>"}}
```

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `decision` · `rejected` · `lesson` · `pitfall` · `rule` · `finding` |
| `content` | ≤ 900 characters (the project may set `enrichMaxChars`). Self-contained, names the system, states the why. |
| `context` | Where it came from, readable: source type, artifact id, repository, title. |
| `timestamp` | When it was **decided** or observed — from the artifact, never the day you ran this. ISO date or datetime. |
| `document_id` | Stable: `<kind>:<repo-or-scope>:<ARTIFACT-ID>[:<slug>]`. Derived from the artifact and the point, never from a counter or a run date — so a re-run replaces instead of duplicating. Letters, digits, `. _ ~ : -`; unique within the file. |
| `tags` | `source:`, `repo:`, `kind:`, `artifact:`, `status:` — structured filters for later correction. |
| `metadata` | String values only. `link` to the artifact (path at a commit, or a URL), `artifact`, `repo` (used for routing). |
| `bank` | Optional. Omit it when the project routes by repository; name it when this item belongs elsewhere. |

### Item rules

- **Self-contained.** It must make sense recalled alone, months later, by someone who never saw
  the source. Name the system and the component; no "this", "the above", "as discussed".
- **States why.** A decision without its reason gets reversed at the first edge case.
- **One point per item.** Two decisions → two items, two `document_id`s.
- **≤ 900 characters, prose.** No tables, no code blocks, no lists of files. If it does not fit,
  it is two items or it is not distilled yet.
- **Links back.** `metadata.link` points at the artifact at a specific commit or permalink.
- **Timestamp = when decided.** A 2024 decision loaded today must not look like news.
- **One bank per item.** Team-wide conventions and one system's internals belong in different
  banks; pick by who needs to recall it.
- **No secrets, no personal data.** No tokens, passwords, connection strings, internal hostnames,
  emails, phone numbers, or people's names — say "the reviewer", "the on-call engineer". The tool
  refuses the shapes it can see; names and hostnames are your job.
- **Quality over count.** Skip the obvious ("we use TypeScript"), the transient (a sprint plan),
  and anything the code itself already says plainly.

## Recipes by source

### Design records (ADR, RFC, NOTE, PROBLEM, EVIDENCE — forgeplan or similar)

Read from the **remote base branch**, not the working tree, which may be stale or carry someone's
unfinished draft:

```bash
git fetch origin
git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/<base> -- <records-dir>/
git show origin/<base>:<records-dir>/<file>.md
git log -1 --format=%h origin/<base> -- <records-dir>/<file>.md   # the commit for metadata.link
```

| Record | Distil into | Skip |
|---|---|---|
| ADR, active | one `decision` (what + why), and one `rejected` per considered alternative that had a stated reason | the context section's background prose |
| ADR, superseded | a `decision` tagged `status:superseded` whose content says what replaced it and why — history, not current guidance | — |
| RFC | only the decisions a newcomer would not guess, each with its why; rejected options with their reason | the plan, the timeline, the task breakdown |
| NOTE | `rule` or `decision` when it states one | notes that are a to-do or a scratchpad |
| PROBLEM | `lesson`: what broke, the root cause, the fix or guard that prevents a repeat | symptom-only reports with no cause |
| EVIDENCE | only verdicts of CONCERNS or BLOCKER that carry a reusable lesson | passing evidence; numbers with no lesson |

Always skip drafts, PRDs, plans, epics and specs still in progress — they record intentions, and
memory should hold what was decided.

### Decision ledgers and mission files

Each recorded decision with a reason becomes a `decision`; each "tried X, abandoned because Y" a
`rejected` or `lesson`. Link to the ledger file at a commit. Skip status updates and assignments.

### Merge / pull request review threads

The valuable part is the **rejected approach and why** — the reviewer's reason that changed the
code. Each becomes a `rejected` or `pitfall` naming the system and the reason. Link the MR/PR URL.
Skip style nits, approvals, and anything resolved as "will do later". Refer to people by role.

### Chat threads

Only decisions **reached** in conversation — something was agreed and why — not opinions or
brainstorming. Only **with the consent of the channel**: ask the channel owner or participants
first; direct messages and private channels are out unless everyone in them agrees. No personal
data: no names, handles or emails; no quotes. Link the permalink; the timestamp is the message
where the decision landed.

### Agent session transcripts — optional second stage only

Only after the artifacts above are done, and only:

- your **own** sessions, and only those run in this project's paths;
- **distilled** into items by the rules above — a transcript is never retained raw, never passed to
  `memory_retain` or `document_ingest`, never attached;
- with anything personal, credential-shaped or unrelated to the project left out.

A transcript is mostly noise around a few decisions; the decisions usually also exist in a commit
message or a record, which is the better link.

## When the runtime has its own retain tool

Some hosts — a chat bot, for instance — expose their own memory tool instead of this plugin,
often limited to certain banks and a smaller content cap. Then use that tool **item by item** with
the same item shape (content, context, timestamp, document_id, tags, metadata), and respect its
limits: write only to the banks it allows, shorten an item to its cap rather than splitting it
into fragments that do not stand alone, and pace the writes. The dry run and the human approval
still happen — show the item list first, write after the yes.

## From a shell

The same pipeline ships as a CLI, reading the same `.hindsight.json` from the working directory:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/enrich.mjs" <file>.jsonl            # dry run
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/enrich.mjs" <file>.jsonl --apply    # write
#   --max-chars N   --batch-size N   --samples N   --json
```

Exit codes: `0` all accepted, `3` some lines refused (the rest planned or written), `1` config,
file, server or batch failure, `2` usage.

## Anti-patterns

- **Ingesting the ADR file itself** with `document_ingest_file` "to be thorough". The bank then
  recalls page-long chunks of background prose, and the one decision in it ranks below them.
- **`content` that needs its source to make sense** — "Decided to go with option C." Option C of
  what, in which system, and why?
- **A `document_id` with a date or a counter in it** (`decision-2026-10-07-3`). The next run cannot
  replace it, so every re-run duplicates the whole set.
- **`timestamp` set to today** for a decision taken last year. Recall's recency weighting then
  presents old reasoning as the latest word.
- **Reading records from the local working tree** when the remote base has moved — loading a
  draft that was never accepted, or missing the supersession that landed yesterday.
- **Applying before a human has seen the dry-run report**, or applying a file edited since the
  report was shown.
- **Silencing a refusal** by mangling the text until the scanner stops matching, instead of
  removing the secret or the personal data.
- **Retaining a chat thread or a session transcript raw** — the exact store-of-conversation this
  plugin turned off by default.
- **Treating a successful apply as done.** The write is queued; a failed extraction shows up only
  in `memory_operations`.
