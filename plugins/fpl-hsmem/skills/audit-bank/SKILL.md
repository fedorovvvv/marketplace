# Audit a memory bank

Six read calls, in this order, ending in a written verdict. Nothing here
writes. Run it on day one of a new bank and any time the answer to "is this
safe" is a shrug.


## Model tier

**This skill asks for tier C for the reads, B for the verdict.**

Collecting the six readings is mechanical.
Turning them into "safe to keep filling / not safe" is not: it weighs masking state against what is
already stored, and the cost of getting it wrong is asymmetric — a false "safe" keeps a bank
accumulating credentials for months. Run it at B; the reads are cheap either way.

`model:` values like `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` are Claude Code names, not the
requirement. On another runtime substitute whatever serves this tier there, and when you cannot
tell, miss **upward**. Saving cost means giving a skill less work, not a weaker model.

## Step 1 — which bank, and who decided

```
memory_get_current_bank
```

Report `default_bank`, `allowed_banks` and `config_file` verbatim. Every bank is chosen on purpose: the only source is the project's
`.hindsight.json`, and a bank is never derived from a directory name or created
on first write. Audit each bank in `allowed_banks` separately — pass `bank` to
every call below — because there is no cross-bank view.

**The failure this catches.** A fact written to the default bank that belonged
in another one is invisible to whoever reads the other bank. If a project feels
"forgetful", check which bank the missing fact was written to before concluding
it was never written.

## Step 2 — privacy posture (do this before counting anything)

```
bank_config_get
```

Three fields decide whether this bank is safe to keep filling:

| Field | Safe value | What the unsafe value means |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_defense` | a policy object | `null` — no secret masking. Anything pasted into a session is stored verbatim |
| `store_document_text` | `false` | `true` — whole raw transcripts are kept, not just extracted facts |
| `audit_log_enabled` | `true` | `false` — there is no record of who read what. "No evidence of access" is not available as a reassurance |

**State the asymmetry out loud in your report.** Turning masking on changes
future writes only. It cleans nothing already stored. A bank that has run
unmasked for months does not become clean by flipping a switch, and the only
remediation for a credential already in it is rotating that credential.

## Step 3 — size and shape

```
memory_status
```

Report counts by fact type. The ratio is informative:

- mostly `observation` — the bank has been consolidating; there are durable
  beliefs, not just raw notes.
- mostly `experience` with few `world` facts — it is recording what the agent
  did rather than what is true. Check what the extractor is instructed to keep.
- a large document count with a small memory count — transcripts are being
  stored but not yielding much. Check step 5.

## Step 4 — what a document is worth

```
document_list  limit=10
```

The `memories` number per document is the blast radius of deleting it, and
nothing else in the system reports it. A document that looks like "one noisy
transcript" routinely carries hundreds of facts.

If step 2 found masking off, this list is also the exposure inventory: each
document is a whole session stored verbatim.

## Step 5 — what silently failed

```
memory_operations  status=failed  limit=20
```

This is the only place a failure is visible. A retain that failed produces no
error anywhere the user can see — the conversation simply never became memory,
and recall answers as if it never happened.

Read the pattern, not just the count:

- **repeated `Fact extraction failed`** — the extraction model is rejecting or
  choking on the input. Long transcripts and unusual content are the usual
  causes.
- **`TimeoutError` on export/import jobs** — the operation is too big for one
  request; it needs splitting, not retrying.
- **failures clustered on one date** — an outage, not a systemic problem.

## Step 6 — spot-check the content

```
memory_list  type=world  limit=5
memory_list  state=invalidated  limit=5
```

Read five actual rows. Counts do not tell you whether the bank is storing
anything worth keeping; five rows do.

An empty `invalidated` list on a large old bank is not good news — it means
nothing has ever been corrected, which for a corpus of thousands of facts is
unlikely to be because they are all right.

## Verdict

Write four lines, in plain language:

1. **Which bank**, and whether anyone chose it.
2. **Whether it is safe to keep filling** — masking, raw storage, audit log.
   If masking is off, say what that means for what is already stored.
3. **Whether it is working** — failed jobs, and whether recent conversations
   actually became memory.
4. **One recommended action**, or "nothing to do".

Do not end with a number. A count is not a verdict.
