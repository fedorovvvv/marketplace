  Look at a project and propose the retrieval and memory layers it should have — what to install,
  what each layer answers, and what it will never answer. The reason this exists: an agent that can
  only grep is slow in a way nobody notices, and an agent with no memory re-learns the same lesson
  every session. Both are invisible from inside a single conversation.
  EN: Inspect a repository and recommend a stack — search layers (LSP, indexed text, AST, semantic)
  and memory layers (a Hindsight bank, knowledge pages, formal decision records). Says what each is
  worth on THIS repo, in this order, and shows the commands. Never installs anything silently.
  NOT the wiring of an already-chosen bank — that is /fpl-hsmem:bootstrap.
  RU: Осмотреть репозиторий и предложить набор — слои поиска (LSP, индексированный текст, AST,
  семантика) и слои памяти (банк Hindsight, страницы знаний, формальные решения). Говорит, чего
  каждый слой стоит именно на ЭТОМ репозитории, в каком порядке ставить, и показывает команды.
  Ничего не ставит молча. НЕ настройка уже выбранного банка — это /fpl-hsmem:bootstrap.

# Set a project up so it can be worked on

## Model tier

**This skill asks for tier B.**

The measurements are mechanical; the recommendation is not. Proposing a heavy
layer for a repository that does not need it wastes real money and setup time,
and omitting one on a repository that does costs an hour of grep per week
forever. The judgement is proportionality, and the oracle — repository size,
language, how often the same question recurs — is available but has to be read.

`model:` values like `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` are Claude Code names, not the
requirement. On another runtime substitute whatever serves tier B there, and
when you cannot tell, miss **upward**.

## The idea in one paragraph

There are two different questions a developer asks all day, and no single tool
answers both. **"Where is it in the code?"** is answered by search — and which
kind of search depends entirely on what you already know about the thing you
are looking for. **"Why is it like that?"** is answered by memory — and code
search cannot answer it at all, because the repository shows what won and never
shows what lost. A project set up well has a layer for each, and knows which one
to reach for.

## Step 1 — measure the repository, do not guess about it

**Count what the fast tools count.** `git ls-files` is the number that decides everything below:
those tools respect `.gitignore`, so vendored dependencies are invisible to them and enormous to
`grep`. Report both, because the gap is usually where a "speedup" actually comes from.

```bash
# size and shape — the FIRST number is the one that decides
git ls-files 2>/dev/null | wc -l                     # tracked files  ← use this
find . -type f -not -path '*/.git/*' | wc -l          # files on disk (for contrast)
git ls-files 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -8
du -sh .git 2>/dev/null                              # history weight
git log --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l                # how much history exists to mine

# what is already installed
command -v rg ast-grep tgrep chunkhound 2>/dev/null
ls .tgrep .chunkhound.json 2>/dev/null

# what memory is already wired
ls .hindsight.json 2>/dev/null && cat .hindsight.json   # never print the tokenFile contents
ls .forgeplan forge docs/adr 2>/dev/null
```

Then read the memory side through the relay:

```
memory_get_current_bank      # is there a bank, and did anyone choose it
memory_status                # size, and whether masking is on
bank_config_get              # privacy posture before you propose filling it further
```

**Report what you found before proposing anything.** A recommendation that does
not name the repository's actual size and language reads as a template, and the
user is right to distrust it.

## Step 1b — say which size bracket this repository is in, and warn on borrowed numbers

Before proposing anything, put the tracked-file count into a bracket **out loud**, and say what
that means. This is the step that stops a small project from being handed a stack sized for
somebody else's monorepo.

| Tracked files | What to propose | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| **under ~1,000** | plain text search only | "A full scan here is already instant. An index would cost more to build and keep fresh than it can return — not recommended." |
| **~1,000 – 10,000** | plain text search; index only if a measurement says so | "Measured on a repository of this size: unindexed 29 ms, indexed 36 ms — the index lost. Yours may differ; the command to check is below." |
| **~10,000 – 100,000** | measure before adopting an index | "This is where the crossover lives and **we have no measurement in this band**. I am not going to guess it for you." |
| **over ~100,000** | an index is likely to win | "The 52× figure comes from a vendor benchmark at 388,000 files and is UNVERIFIED here. It is a reason to measure, not a result." |

**The warning is mandatory whenever a recommendation leans on a borrowed number.** Say it in these
terms: *"the timings I am quoting come from one repository on one machine on one day — they tell
you where to look, not what to do."* A recommendation that hides its provenance is how a team ends
up maintaining an index for a saving that does not exist at their size.

Hand the user the measurement rather than the conclusion:

```bash
time rg -l -F '<a literal that occurs in your code>' .
time <indexer> -l -F '<the same literal>' .    # after building its index
```

**Under 2× difference means the index is not paying for itself.** It has to be built, refreshed
after every large pull, and remembered — and a stale one returns false negatives that look exactly
like an honest "not found".

## Step 2 — the search layers, in the order they earn their place

Each row says what it answers and what it cannot. Propose a layer only when the
measurement in Step 1 supports it; say plainly when one is not worth it here.

| Layer | Answers | Worth it when | Not worth it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LSP** (definition / references / rename) | where a symbol is *actually* used | there is a typed language and a language server. Always first for an exact name — text tools miss re-exports and shadowing, and silently break renames | no language server exists for the stack |
| **Indexed text search** (`tgrep` or equivalent) | where a literal appears, fast, repeatedly | repo-wide searches are frequent and the tree is large. An index turns seconds into milliseconds and the difference compounds over a session | small tree, or one-shot searches — the index build costs more than it saves |
| **`ripgrep`** | where a literal appears, right now | one-shot scans of a subdirectory; no index to keep fresh | repeated repo-wide queries — an index wins there |
| **AST search** (`ast-grep`) | where a *shape* appears; safe codemods | you refactor patterns rather than strings, e.g. "every `throw new Error(...)` call site". Survives renaming and reformatting | plain literal search — it has no regex and no index, and using it there is just slower grep |
| **Semantic code search** (e.g. ChunkHound) | where an *intent* is implemented | you routinely ask questions you cannot name — "where is tenant isolation enforced". Needs an embedding model and an index | the query is exact. Running an embedding pipeline to find `PaymentRepository` is theatre |

**The order matters more than the list.** Discovery first (semantic for abstract
questions, indexed search or LSP for concrete ones), then verification (LSP
references, AST, literal search) on the small candidate set. The failure this
prevents is the read-read-read cascade: opening ten files because the first
search was the wrong kind.

**Say the anti-pattern out loud when you propose the stack**, because each wrong
pairing has a distinct symptom — and in every case the symptom is a *plausible
answer*, not an error:

- **AST tool used for a literal** → a confident small number. Measured on one
  repo: `rg -F` returned 192 files, `ast-grep` 4. Not an error, not a warning —
  a 48× undercount that reads as a result. Slowness is NOT the symptom (167 ms
  vs 53 ms; you will never notice). The cause is broader than "misses strings":
  an AST tool parses only the language you named, so everything in Markdown,
  JSON, YAML and config is invisible to it. And an invalid pattern exits **0**
  with no matches, which is indistinguishable from a correct search that found
  nothing.
- **Text search used for a rename** → callsites silently left behind; the build
  passes and production does not.
- **Semantic search used for an exact identifier** → plausible neighbours
  ranked above the exact hit, top score around 0.65, the definition itself
  fourth or absent.
- **A stale index believed** → the most expensive one. Trigram indexes give
  false NEGATIVES: a symbol added after the last build is not found, and the
  exit code is identical to an honest "no such thing". Reproduced live. An
  empty result from an indexed search is not proof of absence — repeat without
  the index before concluding anything is gone.
- **Verifying with the layer you searched with** → the same snapshot, twice.
- **Any search used to answer "why"** → *see the correction below*. Recorded
  decisions live in the repository and ARE searchable; it is only the
  undecided long tail that search cannot reach.

## Step 3 — the memory layers

| Layer | Holds | Propose when |
|---|---|---|
| **A Hindsight bank** | conversational knowledge: decisions made in chat, things tried and rejected, lessons | the project will run across more than a few sessions. Below that, the bank never fills enough to be worth reading |
| **Auto-hooks** (recall before each prompt, retain after each response) | the corpus itself, without anyone remembering to save | almost always, once a bank exists — this is what makes memory happen instead of being intended |
| **Knowledge pages** (mental models) | a standing answer to a recurring question, rebuilt from memories | you can name a question that gets asked and re-researched repeatedly. Two or three, not ten |
| **Formal decision records** (`.forgeplan/`, ADR/RFC/PRD files) | ratified decisions, with authority | a decision needs to outrank memory. These are the source of truth; memory is what surrounds them |

**The boundary rule, stated to the user as part of the proposal — and it
separates three layers, not two.** "Search answers where, memory answers why"
is the version people repeat, and it is wrong in a way that costs: **ADRs, RFCs
and PRDs are files in the repository.** They are found by the same search tools,
versioned with the code, and they outrank memory. Sending someone past a
ratified written answer to go asking memory is the failure the neat version
produces.

    sources            → what won, no reasons
    recorded decisions → reasons that reached "decided"   ← ask these FIRST
    memory             → the long tail: discussions that decided nothing,
                         rejected options, lessons

If memory answers a "why" and no artifact exists, that is a signal the decision
should be written down — not that memory did the job.

And a memory that names a file is a lead, not a fact. The easy failure is a path
that no longer exists; the expensive one is a path that is still valid while the
claim about it is stale — the coordinate checks out and confirms nothing. Verify
in two steps: does the location exist, and does the claim still match the code.
When layers disagree, the code wins.

## Step 4 — privacy, before you propose filling anything

Read `bank_config_get` and report three fields plainly:

- **`memory_defense`** — `null` means no secret masking. Anything pasted into a
  session is stored verbatim.
- **`store_document_text`** — `true` means whole raw transcripts are kept, not
  just extracted facts.
- **`audit_log_enabled`** — `false` means there is no record of who read what,
  so "no evidence of access" is not available as a reassurance.

**State the asymmetry.** Turning masking on changes future writes only; it
cleans nothing already stored. This is the one thing worth saying before a bank
starts filling, and it is worth nothing said after.

## Step 5 — propose, in order, with commands

Output a short numbered plan. For each item: what it gives, what it costs, and
the exact command. Then stop and let the user choose.

```
For this repo (2,154 files, TypeScript, 3,200 commits, no index, no bank):

1. Indexed text search      — repo-wide search goes from seconds to milliseconds
                              cost: one binary + an index refreshed on pull
                              → brew install <indexer> && <indexer> index .

2. AST search + codemods    — pattern-shaped refactors across 2,154 files without sed
                              cost: one binary
                              → brew install ast-grep

3. A memory bank            — decisions stop being re-litigated every session
                              cost: a server, and everything said gets stored
                              → /fpl-hsmem:bootstrap
                              ⚠ masking is off on this deployment: raw transcripts are
                                stored verbatim. Decide that before turning it on.

4. Semantic code search     — NOT recommended here: your questions in this repo have
                              been exact names, which LSP answers in two keystrokes.
                              Revisit when you start asking "where is X enforced".
```

**Never run the installs.** This skill proposes; the user installs. A setup step
that ran without being asked is indistinguishable from a bug, and the user is
the one who pays for the model, the disk and the leaked transcript.

## Hard rules

1. **Measure before recommending.** No proposal without the tracked-file count
   (`git ls-files`, not `find`), the language, and what is already installed.
2. **Name the size bracket, and warn when a number is borrowed.** Every timing
   in this skill and in `RETRIEVAL-AND-MEMORY.md` comes from one repository on
   one machine on one day. Quote them as a place to look, never as a threshold —
   and say so in the reply, not only in your head. A recommendation whose
   provenance is hidden is how a small project ends up maintaining an index that
   costs more than it saves.
3. **Never propose a layer this repository's size does not justify**, even when
   the user asks for "everything". "Not this one, and here is the measurement"
   is what makes the rest of the list credible.
4. **Recommend against, out loud.** A layer that is not worth it here is a
   finding, not a silence. Saying "not this one, because…" is what makes the
   rest of the list credible.
5. **Never install, never write config.** Propose commands; the user runs them.
6. **Name the privacy state before proposing a bank**, not after.
7. **Never propose two things that do the same job.** Two indexed searchers, or
   two memory relays, is not redundancy — it is a split corpus and a stale one
   of the pair. This exact failure has happened here: one project wrote to three
   banks at once because two servers and a hook each resolved the name
   differently.
8. **If the project is already wired, say which banks it may use.** Report
   `default_bank` and `allowed_banks` from `memory_get_current_bank`; a bank
   that is not on the server must be created by an operator — this plugin
   never creates one.
