/**
 * Shape-based masking of credential-looking text on the way OUT of the relay.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, and what it does not claim to do.
 *
 * This bank stores raw text. `store_document_text` is on, `memory_defense` is null, and the Stop
 * hook uploads whole session transcripts every ten turns. Whatever was pasted into a session is in
 * the corpus verbatim. Enabling masking on the server changes FUTURE writes only — it cleans
 * nothing that is already stored. So the last place a secret can be caught before it re-enters a
 * model's context is here, at the formatter, on the way back out.
 *
 * That makes this a blast-radius reducer, not a control. It matches SHAPES — a JWT looks like a
 * JWT, an AWS key looks like an AWS key. A password that looks like an English word is invisible
 * to it and always will be. Do not treat a redacted transcript as a safe transcript; the only real
 * remediation for an exposed credential is rotation, and the only remediation for an exposed
 * document is deleting it.
 *
 * Applied at every path that emits stored text: recall, list, get, reflect, and truncated upstream
 * error bodies — an error body from this API can quote memory text back at you.
