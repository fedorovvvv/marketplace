# Agent profiles — the CRUD-R-A matrix

Every agent that touches a structured-artifact store maps to **exactly one** profile. The profile fixes the typical model tier (stated in the body, never pinned in frontmatter) and the set of tools the agent must not call. Mixing profiles in one agent means it can no longer be safely composed in a pipeline — refuse, and split it into two agents.

The matrix maps each operation on an artifact (Create / Read / Update / Review / Activate) to a profile.

## The five profiles

| Profile | Role | Produces | Denies (the load-bearing part) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** Creator | makes a new artifact | a draft artifact | Write/Edit/NotebookEdit + `forgeplan_activate` |
| **B** Reviewer | audits one artifact, records a verdict | an EVIDENCE artifact (PASS/CONCERNS/BLOCKER) | Write/Edit/NotebookEdit + `activate` + `reason` + `claims` + `memory_retain` |
| **C** Read-only | researches, returns synthesis | a handoff, no persistence | all mutations (forgeplan + hindsight writes) |
| **C-coder** | writes source code | code changes under `src/` | forgeplan mutations only — Write/Edit/Bash are **allowed** |
| **D** Maintainer | fixes an existing artifact in place | an updated artifact | `forgeplan_new` + Write/Edit + `activate` + `reason` |

## Rule — the profile is the separation-of-duty boundary

The two invariants the matrix exists to enforce:

1. **The creator never activates its own artifact.** Profile A makes drafts; activation is the orchestrator's / gate's call. This is why `forgeplan_activate` is denied for A, B, and D.
2. **The writer of code never records the verdict on it.** Profile C-coder writes the change; a separate Profile B reviewer reads the frozen result and produces the EVIDENCE. Generator ≠ verifier — see `when-to-use.md`.

Profile C-coder is the deliberate exception: it *is* allowed Write/Edit/Bash (it writes real source files), and denies only the artifact-store mutations. Recognise it by that inverted shape.

## Example — picking a profile from "what does it produce?"

```
What does the agent produce?
  new artifact (PRD/RFC/ADR/SPEC)      → Profile A   (adr-architect, specification)
  a verdict + findings on one artifact → Profile B   (code-reviewer, guardian, tester)
  a synthesis returned to caller       → Profile C   (research-analyst)
  source code under src/               → Profile C-coder (coder)
  a fix to metadata/links of an artifact → Profile D (artifact-maintainer)
  a side effect on the world (deploy)  → STOP — that's orchestrator territory, not an agent
```

The last branch matters: an agent that pushes, deploys, or sends a message is not an agent — surface it as an approval gate in the orchestrating skill.

## The B-orchestrator sub-profile

A narrow sub-profile of B for **strategic routers** (the `smith` master-orchestrator). Like Profile B it writes no source, mutates no artifact, activates nothing. Unlike a standard reviewer it does NOT audit one artifact and does NOT produce an EVIDENCE — it reads *broad* project state (health + blocked + stale + git) and returns a **Markdown routing plan** naming which downstream agents to dispatch.

It additionally denies `forgeplan_new`/`update`/`link` (no artifact creation) and `claim`/`release` (it claims no single artifact). Keep the set tiny — ideally one general router. More than 3-4 orchestrator agents across a marketplace is a smell; orchestration logic belongs in skills, not in a proliferation of agents.

## Trap — the "does everything" agent

The most common profile mistake is one agent that creates an artifact, reviews it, and activates it. That agent has no separation of duty — it can rubber-stamp its own work, which is exactly the failure the matrix prevents. Symptom: its `disallowedTools` is short or empty because "it needs everything". Fix: split it along the matrix — one Profile A creator, one Profile B reviewer, and let the orchestrator activate.
